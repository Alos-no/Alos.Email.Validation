# GitHub Actions workflow for publishing NuGet packages using Trusted Publishing.
#
# This workflow automates the publishing process for Alos.Email.Validation:
# 1. Triggers only after CI workflow passes on main branch
# 2. Uses the reusable build workflow to compile in Release configuration
# 3. Authenticates via OIDC (Trusted Publishing) - no long-lived API keys needed
# 4. Pushes packages to NuGet.org (skipping already-published versions)
# 5. Creates Git tags for published packages (v1.0.0, v1.0.1, etc.)
#
# Triggers:
# - Automatically after CI workflow succeeds on main branch
# - When a GitHub Release is published
# - Manual workflow dispatch (for testing or re-publishing)
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Configure Trusted Publishing on NuGet.org:
#    - Go to https://www.nuget.org/account/trustedpublishing
#    - Add a new trusted publisher policy
#    - Repository owner: <your-github-username-or-org>
#    - Repository name: <repo-name>
#    - Workflow file: .github/workflows/publish.yml
#    - Select packages this policy applies to
#
# 2. Configure repository secret:
#    - NUGET_USER: Your NuGet.org username
#
# Published packages:
# - Alos.Email.Validation
